# English-Spanish-Translation-GRU

This project implements a basic neural machine translation system to translate from English to Spanish. It leverages an encoder-decoder architecture built with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and trained on an English-Spanish parallel corpus.

Dependencies

Python 3.x

NumPy

pandas

scikit-learn (for train_test_split)

matplotlib

TensorFlow (2.x recommended)

Keras

# Installation and Execution

1. Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras

2. Download English-Spanish Dataset: Download a suitable dataset (e.g., from an online repository). 

3. Run the code: python english_spanish_translation.py

# Notes

Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., using attention mechanisms, more layers).

Consider a larger dataset as this is key for machine translation performance.

Evaluate using metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) to assess translation quality more accurately.
